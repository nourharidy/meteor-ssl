# SSL for Meteor

#### Simple built-in Meteor SSL functionality for the first time!

## Quickstart
```sh
meteor add nourharidy:ssl 
```
After the package installation has finished, you place your SSL **key** & **cert** files inside your Meteor *private* directory. 

```sh
openssl genrsa -out localhost.key 2048
openssl req -new -x509 -key localhost.key -out localhost.cert -days 3650 -subj /CN=localhost
```
_If you want to use a host other than localhost then replace every reference to “localhost” above witb your custom domain_.

```sh
// server.js
SSL(
  Assets.getText("localhost.key"),
  Assets.getText("localhost.cert"));
// We default to 443 port  
```

## API
### SSL(**key**, **cert**, [**port**])
#### Server Javascript function
The **SSL()** function is used to launch the SSL functionality from the server, the SSL feature wont be present unless you use it, it must only be used inside the *server* directory.

The function has two obligatory arguments: The UTF-8 formatted string of the SSL **key** & the SSL **cert** files, respectively. The third argument is optional: Define the SSL **port** (Default: 443).

Example:
```sh
SSL(
  Assets.getText("localhost.key"),
  Assets.getText("localhost.cert"));
```

### isHTTPS()
#### Client Javascript boolean function
Returns *true* if user is using HTTPS connection

*warning*: Because this is a *client* function, this does not prevent the server from sending templates over HTTP connection, neither it prevents it from sending data over HTTP unless you prevent it from the client side.

### switchHTTPS([port])
#### Client Javascript function
This function refreshes the page after switching the browser to HTTPS. This function takes one optional argument: The SSL port previously specified by the SSL() server function (Default is 443).

Example with the iron:router:
```sh
Router.route('/', function(){
  if(isHTTPS()){
    this.route('home');
  } else {
    switchHTTPS();
  }
})
```
For the above example to work, the HTTP port must be 80, and the HTTPS port must be 443 (default).

## UI Helpers

### {{isHTTPS}}
#### Client boolean UI helper
Returns *true* if user is using HTTPS connection

This UI helper can be used in your template as a condition that returns whether or not the user is using HTTPS. This is useful to show content to the user if he is using HTTPS in certain parts of your templates.
*warning*: Because this is a *client* helper, this does not protect the template views from being sent from the server over HTTP. Using the helper, the templates/views are sent anyway but the user just can't see it unless he uses HTTPS.

Example:
```sh
{{#if isHTTPS}}
You are using HTTPS
{{else}}
You are not using HTTPS
{{/if}}
```

## Notes

* If your SSL Certificate has a password, you will be prompted with "Enter PEM passphrase" everytime the server is started.
* In order for Meteor to use port 443 for SSL (the default port), it must be started as root:
```sh
sudo meteor 
```
Failing to do this can cause error `Error: listen EACCES` being thrown by dependency node-http-proxy
* In order for the *force-ssl* package to work with this package, please make sure the SSL port is 443 (default).
* You have to add the *https://* prefix to the url if you use the port number in the url. For example, assuming you chose *443* as SSL port, this will **NOT** work:
```sh
localhost:443
```
It will keep your browser loading forever instead of redirecting you to an HTTPS connection. To make it work, you have to add the *https//* prefix:
```sh
https://localhost:443
```
This is why you are encouraged to use the default SSL port *443* so you can open:
```sh
https://localhost
```
To Revert the effects caused by running sudo, run this command:
```sh
sudo chown -Rh <username> .meteor/local
```

* This package does not encrypt communication between Meteor & MongoDB, to workaround this you must put MongoDB on Meteor's localhost or a server inside your secure private network.

## FAQ

### Does it support Websockets?
Yes, it encrypts both HTTP packets and Websockets (including DDP).

### Does it work with Phonegap/Cordova?

Yes, when you *run* it in development, just set the **--mobile-server** argument to the the server location preceded by the *https://* prefix & followed by the SSL port, for example if you use it on an Android device:
```sh
meteor run android-device --mobile-server=https://localhost:443
```
When you *build* the mobile application, use the same syntax with the **--server** argument, for example:
```sh
meteor build --server=https://localhost:443
```

### Does it work with server-to-server DDP connections?
Yes, just adjust **DDP.connect()** to the appropriate SSL port.

Example:
```sh
DDP.connect('https://example.com:443');
```
### Does it encrypt the connection between Meteor & MongoDB?

No it doesn't, unless MongoDB is located on localhost, all communication between Meteor & MongoDB is compromised, be careful!

### Browser shows a security warning

This is because your SSL certificate is self-signed, to prevent this you need to buy certificate signed from a Certificate Authority.

### How do i force Meteor to always use SSL?

Set the SSL port to 443 (default) and install the force-ssl smart package:
```sh
meteor add force-ssl
```
